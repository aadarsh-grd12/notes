          What is C? :
          <p class="black">
            C is a general-purpose programming language that was developed in
            the early 1970s by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs. It is widely used
            for system software, application software, and as a foundation for
            learning other programming languages due to its efficiency,
            portability, and close-to-hardware capabilities.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          History of C :
          <p class="black">
            C was created as an evolution of the B programming language to
            develop the UNIX operating system. It has since become one of the
            most influential programming languages, forming the foundation for
            many modern programming languages, including C++, Java, and Python.

          Features of C :
          <p class="black">
            - Simple and easy to learn <br />
            - Portable and efficient <br />
            - Provides low-level memory access <br />
            - Rich set of built-in functions and operators <br />
            - Supports modular programming using functions <br />
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          Applications of C :
          <p class="black">
            C is used in various domains, including: <br />
            - Developing operating systems (e.g., Linux, Windows kernel) <br />
            - Embedded systems programming <br />
            - Developing compilers and interpreters <br />
            - Game development and graphics <br />
            - Network programming <br />
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          Structure of a C Program :
          <p class="black">
            A typical C program includes: <br />
            - Preprocessor directives (e.g., #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;) <br />
            - A `main` function where program execution begins <br />
            - Variable declarations and statements <br />
            Example: 
            <pre>
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
int main() {
    printf("Hello, World!");
    return 0;
}
            </pre>
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          Importance of C :
          <p class="black">
            C remains relevant due to its versatility, performance, and ability
            to provide precise control over hardware resources. It is an
            essential language for programmers who want to delve into
            system-level programming or gain a deeper understanding of computer
            science fundamentals.
